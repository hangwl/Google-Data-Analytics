## Beginner Projects:

**1. Web Scraping**

  - Beautiful Soup
  - Scrapy
  - Selenium

  - Octoparse

**2. Data Cleaning**

  - CDC Wonder
  - Data.gov
  - World Bank
  - Data.world
  - /r/datasets


**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Data analysis is all about answering questions with data.
EDA helps you explore what questions to ask.
This could be done separate from or in conjunction with data cleaning.
Either way, you'll want to accomplish the following during these early investigations:

  - Ask lots of questions about the data
  - Discover the underlying structure of the data.
  - Look for trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
  - Test hypotheses and validate assumptions about the data.
  - Think about what problems you could potentially solve with the data.


**4. Sentiment Analysis**

Typically, it is performed on textual data, which is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) for determining whether data is neutral, positive, or negative.
It may also be used to detect a particular emotion based on a list of words and their corresponding emotions (known as a lexicon).

This type of analysis works well with public review sites and social media platforms, where people are liekly to offer public opinions on various subjects.


**5. Data Visualization**

- Tableau Public
- Google Charts
- Datawrapper
- D3 (Data-Driven Documents)
- RAW Graphs: open source web application which makes it easy to turn spreadsheets or CSV files into a range of chart types that might otherwise be difficult to produce.

**6. End-to-end Project**

Collect your own data to clean, analyze, and interpret.
